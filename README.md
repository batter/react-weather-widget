# Project Description

As a New Yorker, we find changes in weather to be a part of life. To be ready
for the surprise each day, it would be helpful to know what the day will bring.
Create a React/Flux application to forecast the weather and suggest clothing or
accessories that may be required.


## Goals

- Implement an application for live updates of weather
- Display a high level week view
- Display a day view
- Describe weather by activity and temperature
- Offer a garment or accessory for the day
- Sequence by time


## Expectations

- Use node package management
- Base application on React and Flux frameworks
- Leverage [Forecast.io Api](https://developer.forecast.io/) for data
- Test with Mocha or Jest

## Quick Start

```
npm install
npm run watch
```

## Testing

As mentioned, write tests with either the Jest of Mocha frameworks. A testing harness should execute using the following command.

    $ npm test
